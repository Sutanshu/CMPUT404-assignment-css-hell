                    <span>Hello, my name is Sutanshu Seth. <br> I am an undergraduate student pursuing Computer Science at the University of Alberta. <br> I believe cliches are underrated; it is just as important to know what is inside the box as is thinking outside of it. <br> I like problem solving with a good cup of coffee!<br>
            I enjoy going to the gym, cooking, and developing software to solve and automate my mundane tasks. </span>
