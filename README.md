Modification requirement
====================
- *Note*: Tried to make the good.html look as close to the 3rd image in the oatmeal comic as possible. 

- Added  ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="./stylesheet.css">``` in the head tag.
- Skinned the existing css, and overrode mostly everything. Namely: adding a sepia filter to images to give an oldish look. Added a paper background to give it an old timey look. Underlined chapter headings. Added sans-serif font to give it an older look.
